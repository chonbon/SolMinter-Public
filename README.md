# ch0n-minter/SolMinter

Description
This minter was made for degens who do not want to pay for an expensive tool and want to support me! (Ch0n)

While this is free to use, each succesful mint will include a transfer instruction to send 0.0025 sol to a wallet of mine (36kEKjxu3Cnq7MnA36BeNFwRvF5eEm7moGh5DMT2oTq2), this fee may be subject to change and or a Pro version may be released to eliminate this per mint fee. Also this fee is not deducted if the mint fails for whatever reason. In the dashboard there is a fee stat so you can see how much you have paid in fees.

Features
- LaunchMyNFT Mint Module (CMID Scrape, CMID State, Minting)
- Live status with constant TX monitoring for confirmation to see if tx minted or failed
- Select Multiple Wallets in a single task
- Run as many tasks as you want in the background
- Rotates RPCs for even distrubtion during minting
- Logs all console output for the user to see later
- Generate or import any SOL wallet
- Dashboard with mint stats
- Set a webhook for output on mints/fails, with the option to disable fails
- Built in auto update, never miss out on bug fixes/new features!


Future
- Additional Mint modules
- I listen to feedback, bugs/UI will be updated over time as I have the free time to do so
